## What is this anyways?
### Introduction
If you just randomly found this GitHub repository, then this must be confusing. This GitHub repository is for this website: https://betatesters.vercel.app/ â€” which is owned by Atlas, as you can tell. Atlas is a group of developers making a platform for other developers, companies, and individuals. We have also made our own products that you can get for free (some of them) and buy.
### Communications
If you want to get in touch with us, or just see our Discord server, you can join it here: https://dsc.gg/atlasx. Just, please do not troll anyone, you will **be banned**.
## Contributions
We're open to contributions, just open a PR, an issue, or tell us on our Discord! It's fine anywhere, except our DMs.
